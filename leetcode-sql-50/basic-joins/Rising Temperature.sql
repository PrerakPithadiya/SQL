-- This query finds days where the temperature was higher than the previous day
-- It uses a self-join on the Weather table to compare consecutive days
-- Select the id of the day with higher temperature
SELECT
    w1.id
FROM
    Weather w1
    -- Join the Weather table with itself
    -- w1 represents the current day, w2 represents the previous day
    JOIN Weather w2 ON w1.recordDate = DATEADD (DAY, 1, w2.recordDate)
WHERE
    -- Compare temperatures of consecutive days
    -- Only include rows where the current day's temperature is higher
    w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

-- Note: This query assumes that:
-- 1. The Weather table has columns: id, recordDate, and temperature
-- 2. There are no missing dates in the recordDate column
-- 3. The DATEADD function is supported in the SQL dialect being used
-- Potential improvements:
-- 1. Add error handling for missing dates
-- 2. Consider adding an index on the recordDate column for better performance
-- 3. If large datasets are involved, consider partitioning the table by date
