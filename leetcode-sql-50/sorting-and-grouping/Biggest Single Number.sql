-- Explanation:
-- 1. The subquery finds all numbers that appear only once in the MyNumbers table
-- 2. The main query then checks if any single numbers exist:
--    - If no single numbers exist (COUNT(num) = 0), it returns NULL
--    - If single numbers exist, it returns the maximum (biggest) among them
-- 3. The result is aliased as 'num' in the output
-- Note: This query assumes that the MyNumbers table contains a column named 'num'
-- with numeric values. Adjust the column name if necessary.
