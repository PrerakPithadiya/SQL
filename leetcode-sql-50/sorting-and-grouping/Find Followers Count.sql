-- This query retrieves the number of followers for each user in the Followers table
-- It demonstrates the use of COUNT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses in SQL
-- Select the user_id and count of followers
SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM
    Followers
    -- Group the results by user_id to get the count for each user
GROUP BY
    user_id
    -- Order the results by user_id in ascending order
ORDER BY
    user_id ASC;

-- Notes:
-- 1. The COUNT function is used to count the number of follower_id entries for each user
-- 2. The GROUP BY clause ensures that the count is performed for each unique user_id
-- 3. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by user_id in ascending order
-- 4. This query assumes that the Followers table has at least two columns: user_id and follower_id
-- 5. The result set will include all users, even those with zero followers
-- 6. Performance consideration: For large datasets, consider indexing the user_id column
